# Chemical Signal Processing (ChemSP)

Tools to enable signal processing on graphical models of chemical space.

This library is intended to adhere to the functional programming paradigm. For that reason there are no classes
and everything is instead implemented as a series of functions. It is designed to be as lightweight as possible
and not have an excessive number of features.

Feedback on the functional nature of the code would be greatly appreciated.
